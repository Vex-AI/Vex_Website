    "description": "This is an AI I've been building since 2019. It was an Android app made in Java. I had a lot of problems implementing features, mainly machine learning and problems with the play store (it took time to grow, politics and such). So one day I decided to create a version with React and NodeJS (so it's still under construction), with the aim of creating an AI capable of havinga normal conversation with a person and talking about games andvarious subjects... and who knows... becoming a conscious AI (⊙_⊙)",
